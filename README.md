# Python-Assignment-3  TASK 1 
This Python program calculates the factorial of a number using a function. The factorial(n) function starts with result = 1 and uses a for loop to multiply numbers from 1 to n. The user enters a number, which is passed to the function, and the returned factorial value is then displayed as output.
# Python Assignment 3   task 2
This Python program uses the math module to perform mathematical operations on a number entered by the user. It calculates the square root using math.sqrt(), the natural logarithm using math.log(), and the sine value using math.sin(). Finally, it prints all the calculated results in a clear format.
